D1G1T4L T3MPL4RS CIPHER

This is a repo to assist with the use of a Transposition cipher given to us by D1G1T4L T3MPL4R 

The plan is to use this as part of multiple stages in ctf challenges. more info to come.

use the source code of tranposition.py and run the program,
        
Basic usage :  
                
                # python transposition.py  
                  ENTER MESSAGE : Hello World
                
                #python transposition.py --decrypt
                  ENTER MESSAGE : Encrypted text here
