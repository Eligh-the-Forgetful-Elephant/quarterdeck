# view

Static content served at **GET /view**.

- `index.html`, `style.css`, and `static/` (including `static/index.js`) are already in place.
- Paths in `static/index.js` use `static/` so assets resolve under `/view/static/`.

Replace or add files here as needed; the server serves this directory as-is.
